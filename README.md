# MakanApa?
### I love my Indonesian streetfood, and I'd like to share it to the world. Therefore, MakanApa is an app that I make to share fun facts and my personal recommendation based on what type of food you prefer. I also added my personal note and average price of each food, so that you don't you know you are getting the food for the right amount of price. Since most Indonesian streetfood stalls uses gerobak that moves around, I also shared tips on where and when you can find certain streetfoods. ðŸŒ­
